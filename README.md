# TuRent Community
TuRent community is a web based application that tries to solve the problem of house screening by tenants and house advertisment by landlords. What the application does to make sure this is accomplished, is that it;
1. Creates a platform for landlords to advertise their houses.
2. Provides a platform for people (who we reffer to as tenants to check out and find houses fitting their needs without needing to go to the physical location.
3. Provides a way for landlords to ensure that who ever they give a house to, is a person of greate ethic(this is by use of the reviews).
